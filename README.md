# Technology Demos and Overviews

This repository contains demonstrations, notes, and overviews of various technologies I use in my workflow. This serves as both documentation and a reference for setting up and using these tools.

## Technologies

### Infrastructure as Code

#### [Terraform](./terraform.md)

Terraform is an open-source Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tool that allows you to define and provision infrastructure resources using a declarative configuration language. The comprehensive guide includes:

- Core concepts and workflow
- Provider configuration for Azure
- State management strategies
- Module development and usage
- Best practices for production environments
- Example configurations for common Azure resources

**Key features:**
- Declarative syntax with HashiCorp Configuration Language (HCL)
- Multi-cloud support with consistent workflow
- Dependency management and parallel resource creation
- Comprehensive state tracking
- Modular, reusable configurations

### Version Control & Collaboration

#### [Git & GitHub](./git.md)

Git is a distributed version control system, and GitHub is a web-based hosting service for Git repositories. The comprehensive guide includes:

- Setup and configuration
- Basic and advanced workflows
- Branching and merging strategies
- Rebasing techniques and best practices
- Working with remote repositories
- Tag and release management
- Advanced techniques like stashing, cherry-picking, and reflog
- GitHub-specific features like pull requests, actions, and pages

**Key features:**
- Distributed version control with full history
- Branching and merging capabilities
- Support for collaborative workflows
- Extensive tools for fixing mistakes
- GitHub integration for code hosting and collaboration
- Rich ecosystem of integrations and tools

### Web Servers & Proxies

#### [NGINX](./nginx.md)

NGINX is a high-performance web server, reverse proxy, load balancer, and HTTP cache. The comprehensive guide includes:

- Installation and file structure
- Configuration syntax and context hierarchy
- Server blocks and location blocks
- Reverse proxy setup with header management
- Load balancing methods and health checks
- SSL/TLS configuration with security optimization
- HTTP/2 and HTTP/3 implementation
- Security best practices and rate limiting
- Caching strategies and optimization techniques
- Common use cases with sample configurations

**Key features:**
- Asynchronous, event-driven architecture for handling high loads
- Advanced request routing and URL rewriting
- Multiple load balancing algorithms
- Flexible SSL/TLS implementation
- Robust caching capabilities
- Detailed logging and monitoring options

## Future Additions

This repository will be expanded with additional technologies including:

- **Containerization**: Docker, Kubernetes
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions, Azure DevOps
- **Configuration Management**: Ansible
- **Monitoring & Observability**: Prometheus, Grafana
- **Cloud Platforms**: AWS, GCP, Azure

## Usage

Each technology has its own dedicated documentation file with comprehensive information about setup, configuration, best practices, and practical examples.

## Contributing

Feel free to suggest improvements or additional technologies that would be useful to include in this repository.
